Hitbox - special class which was made for easy to use and best response hitboxes. Instead of relying purely on Spatial Query API 
(e.g. `WorldRoot:GetPartBoundsInBox`, `WorldRoot:GetPartBoundsInRadius`, `WorldRoot:GetPartsInPart`) which you mostly do on server for security reasons. This hitbox implementation lets you set network ownership and based on that network owner checks for the collision results.
:::note
All of the data sent by client and collision results will be verified by server, before firing any events prior.

## Types
---

### HitboxConfiguration 
```lua
type HitboxConfiguration = {
	HitboxType: "Magnitude" | "Spatial",
	Shape: "Box" | "Sphere",
	Owner: Player?,
	Id: number,
}
``` 
#### > `HitboxType: "Magnitude" | "Spatial"`
Sets the type of the Hitbox. If set to `Magnitude`, hitbox will perform magnitude checks which will determine the collision result
:::info
`Magnitude` checks will be based on the AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) instead of the typical sphere.
:::
`Spatial` hitboxes use Roblox's [Spatial Query API](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-overlapparams-new-spatial-query-api/1435720) which may yield to better results, but takes longer to compute due to Roblox engine accounting for every part in Octree.

#### > `Shape: "Box" | "Sphere"`
Sets the hitbox collision Shape. Can be only `Box` or `Sphere` hitbox.

#### > `Owner: Player?`
Determines who's the owner of the hitbox and who will perform collision checks
:::note
All of the data and collisions sent from client are verified before firing any events prior.
:::
When Player is set as the network owner, hitbox will **BE** replicated to it and client will continuously check for collisions. If client detects collision it will sent data to server to verify.\
When Server is set as the network owner, hitbox will **NOT** be replicated and all of collision operations will be performed on server-side completely. Don't use server owned hitboxes when doing any kind of interaction player is responsible, best for NPC's or any other stuff server is in charge of.

---

### HitboxParams 
```lua
type HitboxParams = {
	HitboxType: "Magnitude" | "Spatial",
	Shape: "Box" | "Sphere",
	Debug: boolean,
	Size: Vector3,
	CFrame: CFrame?,
	Owner: Player?,
}
```

#### > `HitboxType: "Magnitude" | "Spatial"`

#### > `Shape: "Box" | "Sphere"`
Sets the hitbox collision Shape. Can be only `Box` or `Sphere` hitbox.

#### > `Debug: boolean`
Determines whether collision debug is enabled. If hitbox has network owner that's Player, debug collision will be shown on network owners side too.

#### > `Size: Vector3`
Sets the size of the Hitbox.

#### > `CFrame: CFrame?`
Sets the CFrame of the Hitbox in world space.

#### > `Owner: Player?`
Determines who's the owner of the hitbox and who will perform collision checks
