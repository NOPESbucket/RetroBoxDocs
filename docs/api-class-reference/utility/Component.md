Bind components to Roblox instances using the Component class and CollectionService tags.

To avoid confusion of terms:
- `Component` refers to this module.
- `Component Class` (e.g. `MyComponent` through this documentation) refers to a class created via `Component.new`
- `Component Instance` refers to an instance of a component class.
- `Roblox Instance` refers to the Roblox instance to which the component instance is bound.
Methods and properties are tagged with the above terms to help clarify the level at which they are used.
